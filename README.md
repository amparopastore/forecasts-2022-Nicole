# Hurricane Nicole (2022) Forecasts Visualization
In this project I use public hurricane forecast data from the NHC to create forecast visualizations of hurricane Nicole and perform basic data analysis tasks. I plot the forecasted paths, as well as the true track of the hurricane using interpolation.

This involves:

Importing forecast data from the NHC and grouping it in lists to create visualizations and perform data analysis.
Plotting the true track and the forecasts of the hurricane on a map.
Interpolating the hurricane's path.
Performing basic data analysis tasks.
